These are collections of documents needed to complete the process of
Letter of Undertaking(LUT) for GST registrations. Getting this done
helps in case you are working remotely from India and your clients are
outside India. Though Service Exports are exempted under GST, without
LUT you have to pay 18% tax and then claim the refund for each
return. 

Apart from these PDFs you would need ID Cards of the witness you have
for the LUT, your PAN card and an additional ID proof. There is one
more document missing from current set, GST-RFD-Form11, current format
as tables in it, which I am yet to put together in LaTeX format.
